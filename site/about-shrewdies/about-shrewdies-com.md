This section of the website is not directly about {{ site.subject }}. Because these are "Website Admin" pages. So they explain what {{ site.domain }} is. Also, how you can use this website in the best way.

<h2 id="overview">About {{ site.domain }}</h2>
I started Shrewdies as a learning support project. In the days when `Books for Dummies` was a popular learning brand. But I believe that anyone who wants to learn anything is shrewd, not dumb. Hence, my project is 'for Shrewdies, NOT for Dummies`.

I continue to develop my learning resources. So now, during 2022, I'm republishing this website to provide:<ul>
<li>Documentation for Shrewd Learning Services.</li>
<li>New Shrewd Learning Projects</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details">Details About {{ site.domain }}</h2>
Other pages that explain more about {{ site.domain }} are:
