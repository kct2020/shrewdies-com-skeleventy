<h2 id="next">Your Purpose for {{ site.domain }}</h2>
I've explained why {{ site.domain }} exists. And why you should use it to help arrange your activities more efficiently. So now it's time for you to think carefully about why you are here.

For example, you might just want to find out more about {{ site.domain }}. Or you might want to start your learning project right now.

In the first case, continue to browse these 'About' pages. Then browse facts, examples, and articles. Starting from the Home Page. Or search for topics that interest you using links at the top and bottom of every page.

In the second case, start a project now by writing down why you want to learn about your chosen topic. And what you hope to achieve. Then join the Notification service. So you'll get a message when my learning project guidelines are available.

<h4 id="feedback">{{ title }} Feedback</h4>
Your feedback helps me prioritize adding more articles. In particular, I'd love to know if you want extra "Website Admin" articles. But I also need to know about anything you would change to make this page more useful. So please share your thoughts about <a href="{{ site.social_links.github }}issues/new/choose">improving this page</a>. Or <a href="{{ site.social_links.github }}discussions">discuss your {{ topic }} concerns with other gout sufferers</a>. Also, you can add comments below using my ShrewdChat service.

If you are asking a question, it's best to:
1. Search for that question in <a href="{{ site.searchurl }}">{{ site.searchname }}</a> first.
2. Choose the most relevant result.
3. Refer to that result as you ask your question.
